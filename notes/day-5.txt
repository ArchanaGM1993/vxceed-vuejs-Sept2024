v-model as attribute with nested component for two way binding:

<NestedComp :props-name="data" @update:props-name="parent-method"/>

can be simplified into

<NestedComp v-model:props-name="data"/>

Rule: the event name (emit) must be like this in the nested component=> update:props-name and you must emit that event from the child and also pass data of the same type as that of the props type

if the props name is "modelValue" and the emit name is "update:model-value", then following line can be written

<NestedComp v-model="data"/>

 which is equivalent to 

<NestedComp :model-value="data" @update:model-value="parent-method"/>

but if the props and emit name is something differnt from "modelValue" then following line should be written

<NestedComp v-model:props-name="data"/>
 which is equivalent to 

<NestedComp :props-name="data" @update:props-name="parent-method"/>
